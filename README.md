# CS300 Files and Final Project

This repository contains files used for CS300 coursework at Calvin University. This also includes a Final Project, which used Google's AIY Voice Kit to create a visual representation of local weather information using LEDs, servo, Google Assistant API, Google Drive API, and Google Sheets API.

The complete report of that project can be accessed at https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-chan-young-um/
